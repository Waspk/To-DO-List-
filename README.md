ToDoLy is a console-based application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. It allows users to create, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks, all through a simple text-based user interface (TUI). Additionally, ToDoLy supports saving tasks to a file for persistence between sessions.

Upon launching ToDoLy, you'll be presented with a menu of options to manage your tasks. Here's a brief overview of available actions:

1. Add a New Task: Allows you to create a new task by providing its title, due date, status, and project.
2. Edit a Task: Enables you to modify an existing task's details, such as title, due date, status, or project.
3. Mark a Task as Done: Marks a task as completed.
4. Remove a Task: Deletes a task from the list.
5. Save & Quit: Saves all tasks to a file and exits the application.

To navigate the menu, simply enter the corresponding number for the action you wish to perform and follow the prompts.
